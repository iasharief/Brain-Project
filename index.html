<h1  class='header' >Writing Stamina</h1>
<p>One thing during school that I need to work on is my writing stamina. I get easily distracted and I start to think about other things sometimes, and I can even forget a sentence I want to write after a minute or so. The parts of the brain that help me with stamina and attention are the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata, and the parietal lobe. The cerebellum helps me with attention and skills, so I can focus more to write better. The medulla oblongata helps with alertness, so I donâ€™t drift into La-La-Land and stop thinking about what I have to do. Another problem is sometimes. I forget what I want to write. I get a great idea for a sentence but have to write a few more before that. But then, once I do that, I forget some of the strong words or phrases I want to use, which stops my role. That is a problem. My left parietal lobe is responsible for that, as it helps with short-term verbal memory. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Practice often: every time I write, I should time myself to see how long I can go without stopping for some time. Each day I will try to go for a longer time. This way, I can improve my attention for better stamina. 
</li>
<li>Get good sleep: I donâ€™t want to be nodding off while working, nor do I want to be stressed. I want to get a good nightâ€™s sleep to ensure maximum alertness and minimize stress, not just during writing, but in other subjects and life in general as well.
</li>
<li>Read flashcards with sentences: I can even read flashcards and try to remember sentences for different periods of time to improve my verbal memory, so I donâ€™t forget things after writing for a few minutes.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h1 class='header'>Remembering Formulas and Code</h1>
<p>Another thing that I need to work on is my abilty to remember formulas and scripts of code over long periods of time. Whenever I learn something new, I need to memorize that so when I need to use it next time, I don't have to learn everything all over again. However, I have to do this a lot, so that means I need to improve my memory. The parts of the brain that help me with this are the left parietal lobe, the frontal lobe, and the hippocampus. I need to remember different letters and numbers, which the left parietal lobe helps with on verbal memory. It is also crucial that I can get these memories back, and that is what the frontal lobe does. Finally, the hippocampus helps store long term memories so I can remember these over long periods of time.
 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Flashcards: Make flashcards I can look at many times when learning these things. Then I can remember it better.

</li>

<li>Online Exercises: To improve my memory, I should do exercises online to remember things for long periods of time.


</li>
</ul>

<h1 class='header'>Working with Background Noise</h1>
<p>My final issue is working with tons of background noise. This happens a lot, whether at school or at home. Lawnmovers, hallway noise, loud talking, etc. are all examples of this, and they are really annoying for me. This means I need to improve my attention and ignore this. The parts of the brain that help me with this are the right parietal lobe, the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata. The right parietal lobe helps with attention, so I can keep focusing on my tasks. The cerebellum also plays a small role in that. Finally, the medulla oblongata can help with alertness. These parts are similar to those which help with writing stamina so I can kill two birds with one stone here. This is important because in the modern day world, it happens a lot.

</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a lot of my work with something playing in the background: a news channel or something that could pose as a bit of a distraction, so I can get used to this happening to me. 
</li>

<li>Mind breaks: During school periods, if it is really annoying, take mind break. This might help mentally, and I could forget about the noise if I can get back on task.
